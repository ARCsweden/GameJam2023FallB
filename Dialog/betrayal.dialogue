Narrator: You extract yourself from the Crusty Croissant, exiting into the streets of Monaco.
Narrator: You haven't gotten far when you're hailed by Carabella DiSpagna.
Carabella: Sicario. The deed is done then?
- Yes [State.killed_jean_pierre]
	if State.bakery_killed_staff
		Carabella: So you did. A bit sloppy too... who to pay the protection fee if everyone is dead, Sicario?
		Carabella: Ah well, there's always the younger brother.
	Narrator: Carabella looks thoughtful.
	Carabella: You appear more... effective than I first imagined, Sicario.
	Carabella: I have a proposition for you. Call it an offer you can't refuse.
	Narrator: Out of the corner of your eye, you can see her men closing in around, guns at the ready.

- Yes (lie) [State.killed_jean_pierre == false]
	Narrator: The Don's daughter regards you coldly.
	Carabella: You thought I wouldn't check, Sicario? Bad move...
	=> betrayal
- No [State.killed_jean_pierre == false]
	Narrator: Carabella hesitates, frowning.
	Carabella: Now, why would that be? I can hardly imagine you failed due to lack of skill.
	- Never intended to
		Carabella: Huh. I never thought you would betray my father...
		Narrator: You tense up, readying yourself for a fight.
		Carabella: ...then again, I guess that makes two of us.
	- Bigger fish to fry
		Narrator: She smiles. It is a cold, predatory thing that would giva a shark pause.
		Carabella: My father, no? What a coincidence. I happen to agree.

Carabella: My father has grown old. His ways are no longer effective, especially not in this town.
Carabella: Time has come for new management.
Narrator: She gives you a piercing glance, a slight smile playing on her lips.
Carabella: So, what will it be, Sicario? Will you join my little coup d'Ã©tat?
- Join Carabella
	Narrator: Carabella claps her hands, nodding sharply. Everyone else relaxes.
	Carabella: Capital! Then we have no time to waste. To the mansion!
	Carabella: I will not forget this, Sicario. You will be well compensated.
	Narrator: All of you hop into cars, and soon you are cruising to the DiSpagna mansion, murder in your minds.

- Stay loyal to the Don [State.killed_jean_pierre == false]
	Narrator: This wasn't in the contract. And you never. ever. break a contract.
	Narrator: Carabella can see your decision in your eyes (despite the sunglasses), and she gives a shrug.
	Carabella: Well, I gave you the offer at least.
	=> betrayal
- Decline
	Carabella: Well, I gave you the offer at least.

Narrator: Only the instincts honed over the years saves you.
Narrator: As the tommy-guns start to smatter, you throw yourself behind a nearby garbage container, dodging the lethal hail.
Carabella: After him. We don't have time for distractions.
Carabella: We have to strike now, while the Don is unawares.
Narrator: ...The Don? Truly this day is rife with betrayals.
Narrator: With Carabella's goons in hot pursuit, you throw yourself into the alleyways of Monaco.
