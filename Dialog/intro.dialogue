~ monaco_arrival
Narrator: You are greeted by balmy air smelling of gunsmoke as you exit the Monaco International Airport, weaving through the barricades manned by nervous airport staffers.
Narrator: The streets beyond are cluttered with debris and spent casings, the ongoing effects of a brutal gang conflict, one you are here to either end or add to.
Narrator: An ancient looking shiny black Cadillac awaits you outside, a slim dark-haired woman in a black suit entirely unsuited for the weather leans against it, seemingly unbothered by the distant gunshots, smoking a cigarette.

Woman: You're the one, then, Sicario. My father awaits at the manse.
Narrator: She gestures for you to take the passenger seat while she stubs out her smoke and sits down behind the wheel.
- Converse
	Narrator: Intrigued by this Italian Femme Fatale, you decide to start up a conversation, but the woman appears cold.
	Woman: Time enough for pleasantries once you have your mission, Sicario.
	Narrator: That appears to be that.
- Observe town
	Narrator: You're here for a job. Perhaps it's prudent to keep an eye out.
	Narrator: The road taken through the small port town is a winding one, as the driver clearly avoids certain areas.
	Narrator: Suspicious eyes watch from behind boarded up windows as the gleaming black dinosaur navigates the streets. The Italians are foreigners, and newcomers at that.
	Narrator: They are not welcome here, but they seem to be feared.
- Observe her
	Narrator: The woman; by her own words the daughter of the Don himself, appears to be a cold one, all focus and business. She's attractive enough, but in a jaguar-that-will-eat-your-face kind of way.
	Narrator: If she takes note of your curiosity, she doesn't acknowledge it.

Narrator: No trouble assail you, and arrive at a large mansion with a view of most of the city. The car passes through the gates, the faceless men in suits standing guard closing them behind you.
Woman: Follow.
Narrator: Your watchful eyes catch a number of barely covered up bullet holes in the walls as you walk behind her up a large set of stairs.
Narrator: Perhaps a testament to the violent nature of the acquisition from the previous owner. Or some kind of Italian fashion statement. These guys seem to be all about style.
Narrator: Before long, you are inside the Don's office. The old man is cut from a different time.
Narrator: Cosa Nostra.
Narrator: Don Guiseppe DiSpagna regards you with piercing eyes, behind steepled fingers.
- Professional
	Narrator: You give the man a curt nod, acknowledging but not deferrential. Here, your reputation precedes you.
	Narrator: Eventually, the Don speaks, breaking the silence.
- Guarded
	set State.italian_ally = State.italian_ally - 1
	Narrator: You are careful to not let your feelings show as you endure that regard.
	Narrator: This isn't the first time you've ran into the Italians, and not always on good terms.
	Narrator: That said, they pay well, and you have your own reasons for accepting this job.
- Familiar
	set State.italian_ally = State.italian_ally + 1
	Narrator: This is far from the first time you've met. Back in the old country, the Don frequently requested your services.
	Narrator: You bow, eliciting a slight smile from the old man.
	Don DiSpagna: Ever so formal, friend. Have a seat.
Don DiSpagna: You know I would not call someone of your... caliber, unless it was important.
Don DiSpagna: Our efforts here have taken a sour turn with some rowdy locals. We have need to... see them removed.
Narrator: You raise an eyebrow. The great gang wars have raged for well over a decade now, and the Italians have always been strong. Who could offer them such trouble in a small town like this?
Don DiSpagna: The French.
Narrator: He says it with some distaste, as if biting into a particularly sour olive.
Don DiSpagna: A clan of bakers. Ruffians who refuse to accept our offers of protection.
Don DiSpagna: The brothers Jean-Pierre and Jean-Luc Boulanger. They run the Crusty Croissant down Rue de Millo.
Don DiSpagna: Deal with the older one and the younger will fold... as long as you don't make it obvious who was behind it. We are understood?
Narrator: You nod and rise. There is work to be done.
Narrator: Outside, the woman from before waits for you, her expression unreadable.
Woman: I'm going with you on the job. You'll do the deed, but I will be keeping an eye on you. Just because my father trusts you doesn't mean I do.
Narrator: You smile inwardly. Yes Ma'am.
Woman: It's Carabella DiSpagna, Sicario.

Narrator: Some time later, the two of you are observing the Crusty Croissant from afar. The sign looks like it belongs to a previous era, perhaps twice removed.
Carabella: I take it you came prepared? A tommy-gun is perhaps a bit too obvious, so the means will have to be up to you.
Narrator: You give her a carefully neutral face.
Narrator: Ever since a massive swatch of terrorist attacks and gang conflicts raged across the continent a few years back, airport security had become even more draconean than it was before.
Narrator: People of your presuasion had been forced to... adapt. You checked your pocket to confirm. Inside was...
- Sandwich
	set State.weapon = State.Weapon.Sandwich
	Narrator: ...a club sandwich, carefully wrapped in plastic.
	Narrator: To the unsuspecting TSA agent, it looks like nothing more than lunch, but this particular meal had been meticulously prepared in a bio-lab to cause instant death upon ingestion. 
- Ballpoint pen
	set State.weapon = State.Weapon.Pen
	Narrator: ...a set of common ballpoint pens. At least to the naked eye, which didn't reveal the damascus-crafted tip, sharp enough to pierce kevlar if thrown.
- Nothing
	set State.weapon = State.Weapon.Nothing
	Narrator: ...nothing. You prefer to acquire weapons on site for a job. In hindsight, this particular approach may be ill suited for a Bakery. Ah well.
Narrator: You nod. This is fine.
Carabella: I'll leave you to it then. We'll meet behind the bakery once it's done.
Narrator: You study the front as Carabella drives off. There appears to be a slim frenchman in a stereotypical striped shirt behind the counter, his eyes barely containing his internal rage.
Narrator: Not Jean-Pierre.
- Enter the front
	set State.entry_point = State.EntryPoint.Front
	Narrator: No blood has been shed yet. Surely entering as a customer will work?
- Enter the back door
	set State.entry_point = State.EntryPoint.Back
	Narrator: Figuring that it wouldn't do to draw attention already, you slide up the alley next to the bakery.
	Narrator: The back door is slightly ajar. Murmured voices can be heard in what is presumably French.
# TODO: Should enter the bakery here
=> END


~ bakery_front
# Run this immediately on EntryPoint.Front in the bakery scene
Narrator: You step inside, immediately falling inside the fevered gaze of the cashier.
Frenchman: Qui es-tu? Que veux-tu? (Who are you? What do you want?)
- La mort (death)
	Narrator: The frenchman's eyes widen as he reaches for a hardened battle baguette and a bottle of red wine.
	Frenchman: Viens par lÃ , mon pote! En garde! (Come at me bro! En garde!)
- Pain (bread)
	Narrator: The frenchman's eyes glaze over as he reaches for a hardened battle baguette and a bottle of red wine.
	Frenchman: C'est du pain! En garde! (Bread it is! En garde!)
	
=> END
